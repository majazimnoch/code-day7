# Visual effect using Particles library

## Intro
This is the seventh project of my 30-day coding challenge. The project includes following tech stuff: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Particles JS Library.

## Idea
The idea was to make a visually stunning effect with an animated background and to use the Particles library. Such solution may be used as a part of a bigger website, for example as a hero.

## Breaking down the code
I started off by downloading the ZIP file from <a href="https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/"> here </a>.
Then I added the 'particles.js' and 'app.js' files from the folder to my project folder. I linked them with my html page.
